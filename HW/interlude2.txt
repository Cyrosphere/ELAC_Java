On your hands and feet, you slowly crawl up the stairs. 
Your can feel the stairs are getting narrower and steeper. Just before you give up climbing, you eyes catch something.
It's light! Although dim and small, you can clearly see light up ahead!
It didn't take long before you reach the top of the stairway.
The stairs lead you to a stone corridor. Several lamps are hanging on the ceiling. That is the light source you just saw.
The lamps are dim and the corridor is long, you cannot see the where it leads to.
Carefully advancing along the corridor, you find that there are two doors on  hanging on the wall as well.
