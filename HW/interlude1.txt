Judging by the temperature and humidity, this place might be an underground cave.
If you can feel wind, there must be a way out!
Take a deep breath, you stand up.
The airflow is not very strong, but you can can feel that the wind comes from straight ahead.
With your hands in front of yourself, you follow the wind cautiously.
As you walk, you can feel the wind is getting stronger. So you speed up your pace. Then suddenly...
"DANG~!"
